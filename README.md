# gosubs

A simple tool for generating subtitles using [OpenAI Whisper](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-base) ðŸ“”

## Building for local development

Prerequisites:

1. Linux
2. Git
3. Docker
4. ffmpeg
5. [BrewKit](https://github.com/ispringtech/brewkit)

Firstly, clone the repository into your `$GOPATH`:

```shell
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/nightnoryu
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/nightnoryu
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:nightnoryu/gosubs.git
cd gosubs
```

Then build the binary:

```shell
brewkit build
```

First build may take a while, because we're building whisper.cpp bindings for Go, but subsequent builds will be much faster, harnessing the power of brewkit image caching.
